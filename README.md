# film-plants




There would be a project for the Manufacturer of woven sacks for cement, fertilizer, food grains, FIBC/Jumbo Bags, Leno/Ventilated bags on the film plant
first looking after Development / Installation & commissioning to future troubleshooting of below-mentioned machinery. There would be data and values. That can be plotted and studied. there are plots from different data like

Tape extrusion line ranging (250,350,450,600,750kg/hr to 900kg/hr) for Woven fabric.
Co-Extrusion Tapeline with 600kg/hr. (90mm and 60mm screw dia) which is having excellent sandwiching technology of cast film extrusion use for food packaging and many more engineered tapes for special purpose.
Lamination machines whose working width ranging from 1600mm (with BOPP), 2500mm for FIBC coating & 4000mm tarpaulin fabric coating.
Combined Tape/Monofilament Tape extrusion machine with 450kg/hr, which is equipped with 3 nos of die such as T-die 1250mm, 200nos Flat hole and 200nos round hole die.
there is work on Multifilament machine whose output ranging from 20kg/hr to 40kg/hr only (PP multi-filament spinning machines).
Pelican 6 stations & 8 stations printing machine with 6 & 8 colour viscosity controller of line speed of 150mpm.

Secondly,Â  these would be data and values. That can be plotted and studied. That is providing technical inputs to R&D for further improvements of the product and on material selection and worked as member of the Product Development Team. Specially on Co-extrusion and lamination machine.
Thirdly, there would be input from industries and organisations after that there would be well undertaken many Domestic as well as Overseas techno-commercial assignments.
